# Winterlands
A cozy winter-and-Christmas flavored NeoForge 1.21.1 pack that started as a friends-only world. It's tuned for that perfect seasonal Minecraft phase: frosty landscapes, festive decorations, new Worldgen, and enough performance mods to stay smooth.

## Why You'll Love It
- Winter ambience that feels festive without overwhelming every biome.
- Builder-friendly tools, decorative blocks, and exploration hooks that reward wandering and screenshotting.
- Survival-friendly balance: light progression, QoL mods, and accessibility tweaks for comfy long sessions.
- Multiplayer-ready curation with carefully integrated holiday features.

## Notes for Server Admins
- Match the client stack: **Minecraft 1.21.1 + NeoForge 21.1.215**
- Remove anything on the server-incompatible list before launch:  
  https://github.com/Zzackllack/Winterlands/blob/main/modpack/scripts/server/incompatible-mods.md
- Keep bundled datapacks intact when copying to your server (see `config/paxi/datapacks`) so world tweaks load correctly.
