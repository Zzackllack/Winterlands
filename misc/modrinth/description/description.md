# Winterlands
A cozy winter-and-Christmas flavored NeoForge 1.21.1 pack that started as a friends-only world. It's tuned for that perfect seasonal minecraft phase: frosty landscapes, festive decorations, new Worldgen, and enough performance mods to stay smooth.

## Why You'll Love It

- Winter ambience that feels festive without turning every biome into blinding snow.
- Builder-friendly tools, decorative blocks, and exploration hooks that reward wandering and screenshotting.
- Survival-friendly balance: light progression, QoL mods, and accessibility tweaks to keep long sessions comfy.
- Multiplayer-ready curation.

## Notes for Server Admins

- Match the client stack: Minecraft 1.21.1 and NeoForge 21.1.215.
- Remove anything on the server-incompatible list before launch: [incompatible-mods.md](https://github.com/Zzackllack/Winterlands/blob/main/modpack/scripts/server/incompatible-mods.md).
- Keep bundled datapacks intact when copying to your server (see `config/paxi/datapacks`) so world tweaks load correctly.
