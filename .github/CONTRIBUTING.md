# Contributing to Winterlands

Thanks for your interest in contributing! A few simple guidelines help keep
contributions smooth and reviews fast.

1. Setup prerequisites. This involves cloning the repo, setting up your
   development environment, especially installing packwiz.
2. If your change fixes or implements a feature, open an issue first to
   discuss the design where appropriate.
3. If you're adding a mod request or reporting a bug, use the issue templates
   under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.
4. Open a branch for your work named `pr/<short-desc>` or `feature/<short-desc>`.
5. Keep changes small and focused. Provide a clear PR description and testing
   notes.
6. Be respectful and follow the project's Code of Conduct (`.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`).

If your PR touches configuration or dependency updates, provide rationale in
the PR body and note any risks.

## Update the version parameter

Update the version parameter as follows:

- major: big changes — multiple new mods, resourcepacks, shaders, configs, etc.
- minor: new content mods
- patch: mod updates, new performance mods, fixes, or config changes
